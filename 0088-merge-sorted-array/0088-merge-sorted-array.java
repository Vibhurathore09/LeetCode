//         So lets takes two pointers that mark the end of 2 arrays and i ,that would be the index at which we are going to write the value , now we will compare the values at p1 and p2 and write the value that is larger at index i , after writing we decrement the respective indexes .
// And the another edge case is that if any one of the array is empty arr[i] = [0] , index i-1 and another one is arr[j] = [1,2,3] , index = j-1
// So if we consider the index as i-1 then it becomes negative , which is ArrayIndexOutOfBounds ,so we have to take index >=0 .
